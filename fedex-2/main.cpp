//Josiah Holmes
//CSIS 112 ï¿½ Spring 2016
//Lab 8 - FedEx Part 2. This lab focuses on two packages and performs
//                      various tasks encompassing polymorphism, virtual
//                      functions, pure virtual functions, templates, and
//                      exceptions. This lab also explores the capabilities
//                      of a queue through use of a class template.
